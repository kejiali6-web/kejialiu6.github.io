      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        I’m a BSE Mechanical Engineering Systems student at Arizona State University, passionate about
        building human-centered technologies that bridge engineering and empathy. My work focuses on assistive
        design, sensor integration, and interdisciplinary collaboration across engineering and design.

      <h3>Current Project: Rehab Companion Light</h3>
      <div class="project">
        <p>
          <strong>Rehab Companion Light</strong> is a wearable assistive-tech device that helps rehabilitation
          patients visualize their progress through responsive light feedback. The system detects force and
          movement using pressure and motion sensors, translating data into intuitive LED signals that motivate
          and track daily improvements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project began during my first Delta Program residency and has evolved through mentorship and
          lab collaboration at ASU. My next goal is to create a <em>flexible patch version</em> integrating
          micro-sensors and Bluetooth connectivity for real-time progress tracking.

      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p>
        To make rehabilitation visible, engaging, and emotionally supportive — combining mechanical engineering
        with empathetic design. My goal is to build devices that don’t just work, but communicate care.
